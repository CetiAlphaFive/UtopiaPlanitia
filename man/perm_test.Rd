\title{Permutation Variable Importance for Generalized Random Forests}
\usage{
perm_test(forest, n.perm = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{forest}{A fitted random forest model object from the \code{grf} package.}

\item{n.perm}{An integer specifying the number of permutations to perform for each feature. Default is 50.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the RMSE differences for each feature across permutations.
}
\description{
Computes the permutation variable importance for each feature in a generalized random forest model.
}
\details{
This function computes the permutation variable importance by permuting each feature and measuring the increase in RMSE. The importance is calculated as the difference between the RMSE with the permuted feature and the original RMSE.

For reproducible results, set a random seed before calling the function using \code{set.seed()}.

# Toy setup
n <- 500
p <- 5
X <- as.data.frame(matrix(rnorm(n * p, 0, 1), n, p))
Y <- X[, 1] + rnorm(n)
rf <- grf::regression_forest(Y = Y, X = X)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1995)

# Run the permutation test
perm_results <- perm_test(forest = rf, n.perm = 50)
