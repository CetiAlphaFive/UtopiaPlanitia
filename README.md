# UtopiaPlanitia

UtopiaPlanitia is an R package to store miscellaneous functions I'm in the process of constructing and validating. Currently this includes a few variable importance functions for causal machine learning applications, tests for treatment effect heterogeneity, and associated visualizations. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of UtopiaPlanitia from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("CetiAlphaFive/UtopiaPlanitia")
